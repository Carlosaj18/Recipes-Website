    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 pounds lean ground beef</li>
      <li>0.5 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>0.5 cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix,
        minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley,
        basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your
        hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).

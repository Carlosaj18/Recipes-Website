  <p>The best pasta.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pints (20 ounces) cherry tomatoe</li>
      <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

      <li>10 ounces mezze rigatoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and
        several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Transfer
        to a 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish, place the feta in the center of the
        tomatoes and season with a pinch of black pepper. Bake until the
        tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about 30 minutes. Raise
        the heat to 450 degrees F and continue to cook until the tomatoes and
        feta are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over
        high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes.
        Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then thoroughly drain the pasta
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as the tomatoes and feta come out of the oven, stir in the
        garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Use the back of a spoon to
        smash the tomatoes and feta into a smooth and creamy sauce (it’s okay if
        some of the oil isn’t fully integrated). Add the pasta and half the
        basil and toss until evenly coated. If the sauce is too thick, stir in
        some pasta water a couple tablespoons at a time. Taste and adjust the
        seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve topped with the remaining basil
        and a pinch of sea salt.
